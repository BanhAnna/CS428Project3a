# CS 428 Project 2

> _This has been tested on version 2019.4.28f1 of the Unity software_


## Introduction

This project is to depict a phobia and help the user over coming their fear using the Oculus Quest and Unity. The phobia I chose to represent is Ludophobia or the fear of games. Because of the recent success of the show Squid Game, I decided to build the office like the show. The show had many games that included red light green light, marbles, and tug of war. The fun colors and music of the office is to put the player at ease. The office even has some presents on display for the user who overcomes their fear! This project is a VR game using the components from the VRTK suite within the [Unity] software.
